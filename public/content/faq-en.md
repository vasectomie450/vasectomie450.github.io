# General Information about Vasectomy

## What is a vasectomy?
A vasectomy is a form of male contraception that prevents sperm from being transported in your semen. It involves cutting and sealing the tubes (also called vas deferens) that carry sperm. Considered a permanent form of birth control, it is a minor procedure performed under local anesthesia in a medical office.

Remember, a vasectomy should be considered a permanent decision, and it's important to be certain that you do not want children in the future. For detailed information, consult your healthcare provider.

## Why choose a vasectomy?
1. Because you are ready to become sterile and do not wish to father children.
2. Because you want to avoid hormonal contraception.
3. Because you want the most effective form of contraception: vasectomy with fascial interposition has a 99.9% success rate after confirming sterility with a semen analysis.
4. Because it allows for more spontaneity during sex.
5. Because men can also take responsibility for contraception.
6. Because male sterilization is simpler, requires fewer resources, and has a quicker recovery than female sterilization.
7. Some people see it as an environmentally responsible choice.
8. Because it's a great return on investment.
9. To have more time to care for the children you already have.
10. Because contraception is a responsible choice.

## Is there a minimum age to choose voluntary sterilization?
You must be of legal age to consent. Our clinic accepts patients aged 25 and older. In some cases, we may determine that vasectomy is not the best option. This will be assessed during the pre-procedure consultation with the physician.

## Are there common misconceptions about vasectomy?
Yes, common myths include concerns about sexual performance, severe pain, increased cancer or heart disease risk, and permanent damage to sexual organs. None of these concerns are supported by scientific evidence.

## Is vasectomy free in Quebec?
Yes, vasectomy is covered by RAMQ and is therefore free. However, wait times in the public system can be up to two years. A referral from a doctor is often required.

In Quebec, doctors cannot work in both the public and private sectors, unlike in the U.S., Australia, the U.K., or Germany. Rising costs and frozen fees by RAMQ threaten the sustainability of free vasectomy services.

Dr. Savard-Côté has not participated in RAMQ since 2022, so you will have to pay for your procedure and will not be reimbursed by RAMQ. If cost is a concern, we can help you explore alternative solutions.

# Preparation and Procedure

## How should I prepare for a vasectomy?
Preparation includes stopping certain medications like blood thinners, wearing tight underwear or an athletic supporter after the procedure, and ensuring good hygiene the day of the surgery. Arrange for someone to drive you home afterward.

## What does the procedure involve?
The procedure takes about 10 to 30 minutes. It involves numbing the scrotum, making a small incision or puncture, locating and cutting the vas deferens, and sealing it. It is typically done in a doctor’s office or surgical center under local anesthesia.

## Is the needle-free technique better?
The effectiveness, speed, and sensation of anesthesia are similar. For patients with thicker skin or tissue, using a small needle may provide better deep tissue anesthesia. It’s also quieter and less noticeable.

## Can my partner be present during the vasectomy?
Yes, if both of you are comfortable with it.

# Recovery and Effectiveness

## What is recovery like after a vasectomy?
Expect bruising, swelling, and discomfort, which usually resolve in a few days. Support your scrotum, apply ice packs, limit physical activity, and avoid sexual activity for a short period.

## How effective is vasectomy, and when can I resume sexual activity?
Vasectomy is not immediately effective. Use another form of contraception until a semen analysis confirms there are no sperm present. Sexual activity can usually resume one week after the procedure.

## What if I haven’t ejaculated 30 times before my semen analysis?
If you've had several ejaculations—even if fewer than 30—you're likely sterile. If sperm are still present, you’ll need to repeat the test in six weeks. If you've only had two ejaculations, try a bit harder!

## Why wait 3 months after vasectomy?
Sperm can remain in the ducts near the prostate and seminal vesicles for several weeks. Early reconnection (recanalization) is also more likely during the first 12 weeks.

## Do I need yearly semen tests to confirm sterility?
No. Late recanalization is extremely rare—about 1 in 2,000 to 3,000 men. In comparison, 9% of women using birth control pills get pregnant within a year. Once a post-vasectomy semen analysis confirms sterility, no further contraception is needed.

## Can I lift my children after the vasectomy?
No heavy lifting for 48 hours. Avoid lifting more than 10 kg (22 lbs) for 5–7 days. Be cautious when placing your child in a car seat, as it requires awkward movements that can cause swelling.

## When can I resume sexual activity?
Avoid sex for 5–7 days to allow proper healing and reduce the risk of infection. Continue to use contraception until sterility is confirmed.

## What if I get a nocturnal erection after the vasectomy?
No problem—these are normal and pose no risk. However, avoid sexual activity for 5–7 days post-op.

# Health and Complications

## Are there risks or side effects?
Possible regrets if you change your mind, as reversal isn’t always successful. Common side effects include bleeding, bruising, infection, minor pain, and swelling. Chronic pain and serious complications are rare.

## Does vasectomy protect against STIs?
No. Use condoms or other protection if there's a risk of sexually transmitted infections.

## How is success confirmed?
A semen analysis is usually done 6–12 weeks after the procedure to ensure no sperm remain.

## What happens to sperm after a vasectomy?
You continue to produce sperm, but they are broken down and absorbed by your body—a process that already happens naturally for unused cells.

## Does a vasectomy hurt?
Studies show most men report pain levels of 0 to 2 on a scale of 10.

## Does it reduce sexual pleasure?
No. Hormones, erections, ejaculation, and orgasm remain unchanged. Many men report enhanced pleasure due to peace of mind and spontaneity.

## What happens to the titanium microclips? Can I feel them?
Tiny titanium clips are placed on the sheath of each vas. You may eventually feel a small lump, but the clips are surrounded by scar tissue and are not directly palpable. Titanium is safe, non-corrosive, and doesn’t trigger airport metal detectors. If absorbable sutures are used instead, there’s no difference in outcome.

## What keeps the testicles in place after the vas is cut?
The vas deferens do not support the testicles. The spermatic cord, made of muscles and membranes, holds the testicles in place. Their position does not change after vasectomy.

## Will my testosterone levels change?
No. Only the sperm-carrying ducts are affected. Blood vessels that transport testosterone remain intact, and multiple studies confirm normal sexual function post-vasectomy.

# Other Practical Questions

## Can I drink alcohol after a vasectomy?
Moderate alcohol consumption is fine unless you’re taking medication that interacts with it.

## Can I drive after the vasectomy?
It’s highly recommended to have someone accompany you. Around 1 in 10 men may experience lightheadedness or fainting. Driving, especially manual transmission vehicles, is not advised for the first 48 hours.

## Can I travel after a vasectomy?
Avoid international travel or remote destinations for 1–2 weeks. Air travel is allowed after 4 days to allow any air bubbles from the procedure to dissipate.

## How do I get reimbursed for a vasectomy?
Check with your private insurance. In Canada and Quebec, you may claim the expense on your tax return:

- [Canada Revenue Agency – Medical Expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4065/medical-expenses.html#toc14)
- [Revenu Québec – Medical Expenses Credit](https://www.revenuquebec.ca/fr/citoyens/credits-dimpot/frais-medicaux/)

Note: RAMQ does not reimburse procedures performed by non-participating physicians.
